## Events

ðŸ”¥ Also see [`presonus-studiolive-api-simple-api`](https://github.com/featherbear/presonus-studiolive-api-simple-api)

Events are split into data events and lifecycle events.  

### Data Events


```js
import { MessageCode } from 'presonus-studiolive-api'

// Listen for changes to settings
<Client>.on(MessageCode.Setting, function(data) {
    console.log(data)
})
```

> or

```js
// Listen for changes to settings
<Client>.on("PV", (data) => {
    console.log(data)
})
```

Specific events can be listened to by attaching an event handler with `<Client>.on(type, callback)`.  
A list of possible event types are given in [enum:`MessageCode`](#enum-MessageCode).

To listen to **all events**, attach an event handler to the `data` event.  
This event will be emitted after the specific event is emitted.

To listen to **meter events**, attach an event handler to the `meter` event.  
**See [Metering](#metering)**

### Lifecycle Events

> Lifecycle Events

```js
client.on('connected', () => {
    console.log("Connected to the device!")
})
```

To trigger a function when client has successfully connected to the console, listen to the `connected` event.  

Other events: `closed`, `error`, `reconnecting`

```js
client.connect().then(() => {
    console.log("Also connected to the device!")
})
```

Note: The `<Client>.connect(...)` function returns a Promise, so you may use `.then(cb)` to continue execution after connection
